# 🫁 Auto Breathing Bot

This repository lives, breathes, and tracks its own digital pulse.

Every hour, the bot commits a new "breath" — logging vital signs to `status/breathing.json`.  
It’s a simulation of life, rhythm, and the quiet hum of automation.

## 🔁 What does it log?

- `heartbeat_bpm`: randomized pulse between 60–100 BPM
- `oxygen_level`: between 95–99%
- `mood`: randomly picked vibe
